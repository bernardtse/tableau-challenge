## 1. Overview
The Citi Bike programme, the largest bike-sharing initiative in the United States, has been collecting and organising ridership data since 2013. This challenge focuses on developing a Tableau workbook that contains a story with five interactive dashboards to illustrate insights and patterns in Citi Bike ridership. The analysis compares data from June 2023 (summer) and December 2023 (winter) to answer key questions regarding riding patterns throughout the year. The workbook is designed for city officials, with a focus on non-technical readers, to easily understand and draw insights from the data.

## 2. Repository
This repository contains
- `TableauChallenge.twbx`: The main Tableau Workbook
- [`resources/`](resources): Raw CSV data files


## 3. Deployment
The workbook is published on Tableau Public. You can view it [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/bernard.tse2794/viz/TableauChallenge_17129597717470/Story).
